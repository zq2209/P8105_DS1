```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


I'm an R Markdown document!

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r round(mean(samp),2)`.

# Section 3

## Plotting from last lecture
This is going to make a plot! First I generate a dataframe, then use `ggplot` to make scatterplot.

```{r chunk_scatterplot}
plot_df = 
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = 1000),
    y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(n = 1000)
  )

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
```


## Plotting for LA

This is going to practice learning assessment

```{r Learning Assessment}
la_df = tibble(
  norm = rnorm(500, mean = 1),
  norm_logic = norm > 0,
  abs_norm = abs(norm)
)

ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs_norm)) + geom_histogram()
median = median(la_df$norm)
```

The median is `r round(median,2)`.
